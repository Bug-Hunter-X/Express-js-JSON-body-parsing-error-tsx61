# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with JSON request bodies in Express.js applications. The error occurs when the request body is either empty or contains invalid JSON data. 

## Problem

The provided Express.js application attempts to parse the JSON request body using `express.json()`. However, if the incoming request body is empty or contains invalid JSON, the application will either fail silently or throw an error. This can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging challenging.

## Solution

The solution involves adding error handling to gracefully manage cases where the request body is empty or malformed. This ensures that the application responds appropriately and doesn't crash.
